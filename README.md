# Seoul_Bike_Rental_Prediction

I want to predict the required number of bikes for rental given information about the weather and time of the day.

The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Log Error RMSLE.

The dataset is obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository - Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset.
